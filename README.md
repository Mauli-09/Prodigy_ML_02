This project uses K-means clustering to segment retail store customers based on annual income and spending score, aiming to improve marketing strategies. Data preprocessing and the Elbow Method determined five optimal clusters, revealing distinct customer groups: high-income, high-spending customers (ideal for premium offers), high-income, low-spending customers (potential to increase spending), average-income, average-spending customers (responsive to general marketing), low-income, high-spending loyal customers (good for loyalty programs), and low-income, low-spending customers (sensitive to discounts). These insights allow the store to personalize promotions, potentially boosting customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sales through targeted marketing.
